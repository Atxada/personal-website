> This cinematic video is for a PUBG Halloween event game. In this project, I help my colleague with rigging a few props like a Tree, Guitar, and weapons. The hardest part is creating <CodeText>Tree_Rig</CodeText> because I need to mimic the tree growing simulation using only joints for game engine compatibility.
